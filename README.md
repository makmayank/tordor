# tordor
Script Description:
A simple torrent download with some magic.
It is a Python based torrent downloading tool.
Torrent activity handled with libtorrent pyhton library which is available in pip as well as major package managers in linux.
Torrents are dowloaded to Google Colab cloud but can be saved to Google drive of any account which, Ofcourse , requires you to login to the account.

Note:Script is just Mera beta ! Don't expect it to be a full blown Project.
Feel free to Fork it up !

Why ?
At many places torrents are blocked and so the most of the sites which provides torrent functionality "Damn those who do it".
But i haven't got to any place where Google is Blocked. Have you ? 
Also Google is free from ISP throttling , which gives you advantage of forever best speed of the network.
Thanks !
Any suggestions would be entertained !
